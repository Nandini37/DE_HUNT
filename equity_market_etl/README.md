# Equity Market Data ETL Pipeline

## Project Overview
This project implements a robust, modular ETL pipeline for ingesting, transforming, and storing equity market OHLCV data, with technical indicator computation. The design is inspired by best practices used in hedge funds and quantitative research firms (e.g., D. E. Shaw, Two Sigma).

## Project Plan & Steps

### 1. Requirements & Design
- Define business and technical requirements (tickers, frequency, indicators, latency, data retention, etc.)
- Choose data sources (e.g., yFinance, Alpha Vantage, direct exchange feeds)
- Design modular, extensible folder structure
- Plan for configuration management and secrets handling

### 2. Data Ingestion
- Implement connectors for chosen data sources (APIs, SFTP, etc.)
- Support for multiple frequencies (daily, hourly, minute)
- Handle missing data, retries, and logging
- Store raw data in a landing zone or staging area

### 3. Data Validation & Quality
- Validate schema, data types, and completeness
- Implement anomaly detection (e.g., outlier prices, volume spikes)
- Log and alert on data quality issues

### 4. Data Transformation
- Compute technical indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, etc.)
- Support for custom and extensible indicator modules
- Ensure reproducibility and versioning of transformation logic

### 5. Data Storage
- Design normalized schema for OHLCV and indicators
- Use PostgreSQL (or scalable DB) for structured storage
- Implement upserts and deduplication
- Plan for partitioning and indexing for performance

### 6. Orchestration & Scheduling
- Central ETL pipeline orchestrator (see `etl/pipeline.py`)
- Support for batch and incremental loads
- Integrate with workflow schedulers (e.g., Airflow, Prefect) for production

### 7. Monitoring & Logging
- Centralized logging (see `utils/logger.py`)
- Metrics for pipeline health, latency, and data volumes
- Alerting on failures or anomalies

### 8. Configuration & Secrets Management
- Central config file (`config/settings.py`)
- Use environment variables or vaults for sensitive info
- Document all configurable parameters

### 9. Testing & Validation
- Unit and integration tests for all modules
- Data quality and backtesting checks
- Continuous integration setup

### 10. Documentation & Extensibility
- Document all modules and pipeline steps
- Guidelines for adding new data sources or indicators
- Best practices for scaling and productionizing

## Best Practices for Institutional-Grade Pipelines
- Modular, testable codebase
- Idempotent and restartable ETL steps
- Version control for code and transformation logic
- Secure secrets management
- Monitoring, alerting, and robust error handling
- Extensible for new asset classes, data sources, and analytics

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo and install dependencies (`requirements.txt`)
2. Configure your tickers, DB, and API keys in `config/settings.py`
3. Run the pipeline: `python main.py`
4. Extend as needed for your quant research or trading needs

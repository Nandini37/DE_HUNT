# indicators

This folder contains modules for computing technical indicators on OHLCV data.

- `technicals.py`: Functions to calculate indicators such as SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, etc.
- `__init__.py`: Makes this directory a Python package.

All indicator logic should be implemented here for modularity and reuse.

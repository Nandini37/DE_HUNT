# etl

This folder contains the orchestration logic for the ETL pipeline.

- `pipeline.py`: Main pipeline logic to coordinate data ingestion, transformation (indicator calculation), and loading into the database.
- `__init__.py`: Makes this directory a Python package.

The ETL process should be modular and easy to extend.
